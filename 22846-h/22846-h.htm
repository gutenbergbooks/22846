      Amongst the many pleasant circumstances attendant on a love of flowers&mdash;that
      sort of love which leads us into the woods for the earliest primrose, or
      to the river side for the latest forget-me-not, and carries us to the
      parching heath or the watery mere to procure for the cultivated, or, if I
      may use the expression, the <i>tame</i> beauties of the parterre, the soil
      that they love; amongst the many gratifications which such pursuits bring
      with them, such as seeing in the seasons in which it shows best, the
      prettiest, coyest, most unhackneyed scenery, and taking, with just motive
      enough for stimulus and for reward, drives and walks which approach to
      fatigue, without being fatiguing; amongst all the delights consequent on a
      love of flowers, I know none greater than the half unconscious and wholly
      unintended manner in which such expeditions make us acquainted with the
      peasant children of remote and out-of-the-way regions, the inhabitants of
      the wild woodlands and still wilder commons of the hilly part of the north
      of Hampshire, which forms so strong a contrast with this sunny and
      populous county of Berks, whose very fields are gay and neat as gardens,
      and whose roads are as level and even as a gravel-walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the most interesting of these flower-formed acquaintances, were my
      little friends Harry and Bessy Leigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every year I go to the Everley woods to gather wild lilies of the valley.
      It is one of the delights that May&mdash;the charming, ay, and the merry
      month of May, which I love as fondly as ever that bright and joyous season
      was loved by our older poets&mdash;regularly brings in her train; one of
      those rational pleasures in which (and it is the great point of
      superiority over pleasures that are artificial and worldly) there is no
      disappointment. About four years ago, I made such a visit. The day was
      glorious, and we had driven through lanes perfumed by the fresh green
      birch, with its bark silvery and many-tinted, and over commons where the
      very air was loaded with the heavy fragrance of the furze, an odour
      resembling in richness its golden blossoms, just as the scent of the birch
      is cool, refreshing, and penetrating, like the exquisite colour of its
      young leaves, until we reached the top of the hill, where, on one side,
      the enclosed wood, where the lilies grow, sank gradually, in an
      amphitheatre of natural terraces, to a piece of water at the bottom;
      whilst on the other, the wild open heath formed a sort of promontory
      overhanging a steep ravine, through which a slow and sluggish stream crept
      along amongst stunted alders, until it was lost in the deep recesses of
      Lidhurst Forest, over the tall trees of which we literally looked down. We
      had come without a servant; and on arriving at the gate of the wood with
      neither human figure nor human habitation in sight, and a high-blooded and
      high-spirited horse in the phaeton, we began to feel all the awkwardness
      of our situation. My companion, however, at length espied a thin wreath of
      smoke issuing from a small clay-built hut thatched with furze, built
      against the steepest part of the hill, of which it seemed a mere
      excrescence, about half way down the declivity; and, on calling aloud, two
      children, who had been picking up dry stumps of heath and gorse, and
      collecting them in a heap for fuel at the door of their hovel, first
      carefully deposited their little load, and then came running to know what
      we wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we had wondered to see human beings living in a habitation, which, both
      for space and appearance, would have been despised by a pig of any
      pretension, as too small and too mean for his accommodation, so we were
      again surprised at the strange union of poverty and content evinced by the
      apparel and countenances of its young inmates. The children, bareheaded
      and barefooted, and with little more clothing than one shabby-looking
      garment, were yet as fine, sturdy, hardy, ruddy, sunburnt urchins, as one
      should see on a summer day. They were clean, too: the stunted bit of
      raiment was patched, but not ragged; and when the girl, (for, although it
      was rather difficult to distinguish between the brother and sister, the
      pair were of different sexes,) when the bright-eyed, square-made, upright
      little damsel clasped her two brown hands together, on the top of her
      head, pressed down her thick curls, looking at us and listening to us with
      an air of the most intelligent attention that returned our curiosity with
      interest; and when the boy, in answer to our inquiry if he could hold a
      horse, clutched the reins with his small fingers, and planted himself
      beside our high-mettled steed with an air of firm determination, that
      seemed to say, "I'm your master! Run away if you dare!" we both of us felt
      that they were subjects for a picture, and that, though Sir Joshua might
      not have painted them, Gainsborough and our own Collins would.
    </p>
    <p>
      But besides their exceeding picturesqueness, the evident content, and
      helpfulness, and industry of these little creatures, was delightful to
      look at and to think of. In conversation they were at once very civil and
      respectful (Bessy dropping her little curtsy, and Harry putting his hand
      to the lock of hair where the hat should have been, at every sentence they
      uttered) and perfectly frank and unfearing. In answer to our questions,
      they told us that "Father was a broom-maker, from the low country; that he
      had come to these parts and married mother, and built their cottage,
      because houses were so scarce hereabouts, and because of its convenience
      to the heath; that they had done very well till the last winter, when poor
      father had had the fever for five months, and they had had much ado to get
      on; but that father was brave again now, and was building <i>another house</i>
      (house!!) larger and finer, upon Squire Benson's lands: the squire had
      promised them a garden from the waste, and mother hoped to keep a pig.
      They were trying to get all the money they could to buy the pig; and what
      his honour had promised them for holding the horse, was all to be given to
      mother for that purpose."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible not to be charmed with these children. We went again and
      again to the Everley wood, partly to gather lilies, partly to rejoice in
      the trees with their young leaves so beautiful in texture as well as in
      colour, but chiefly to indulge ourselves in the pleasure of talking to the
      children, of adding something to their scanty stock of clothing, (Bessy
      ran as fast as her feet could carry her to the clear pool at the bottom of
      the wood, to look at herself in her new bonnet,) and of assisting in the
      accumulations of the Grand Pig Savings' Bank, by engaging Harry to hold
      the horse, and Bessy to help fill the lily basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      This employment, by showing that the lilies had a money value, put a new
      branch of traffic into the heads of these thoughtful children, already
      accustomed to gather heath for their father's brooms, and to collect the
      dead furze which served as fuel to the family. After gaining permission of
      the farmer who rented the wood, and ascertaining that we had no objection,
      they set about making nosegays of the flowers, and collecting the roots
      for sale, and actually stood two Saturdays in Belford market (the smallest
      merchants of a surety that ever appeared in that rural Exchange) to
      dispose of their wares; having obtained a cast in a waggon there and back,
      and carrying home faithfully every penny of their gainings, to deposit in
      the common stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next year we lost sight of them. No smoke issued from the small
      chimney by the hill-side. The hut itself was half demolished by wind and
      weather; its tenants had emigrated to the new house on Squire Benson's
      land; and after two or three attempts to understand and to follow the
      directions as to the spot given us by the good farmer at Everley, we were
      forced to give up the search.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accident, the great discoverer and recoverer of lost goods, at last
      restored to us these good little children. It happened as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      In new potting some large hydrangeas, we were seized with a desire to give
      the blue tinge to the petals, which so greatly improves the beauty of that
      fine bold flower, and which is so desirable when they are placed, as these
      were destined to be, in the midst of red and pink blossoms, fuchsias,
      salvias, and geraniums. Accordingly, we sallied forth to a place called
      the Moss, a wild tract of moorland lying about a mile to the right of the
      road to Everley, and famous for the red bog, produced, I presume, by
      chalybeate springs, which, when mixed with the fine Bagshot silver sand,
      is so effectual in changing the colour of flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bleak gusty day in February, raining by fits, but not with
      sufficient violence to deter me from an expedition to which I had taken a
      fancy. Putting up, therefore, the head and apron of the phaeton, and
      followed by one lad (the shrewd boy Dick) on horseback, and another (John,
      the steady gardening youth) in a cart laden with tubs and sacks, spades
      and watering-pots, to procure and contain the bog mould, (for we were
      prudently determined to provide for all emergencies, and to carry with us
      fit receptacles to receive our treasure, whether it presented itself in
      the form of red earth or of red mud,) our little procession set forth
      early in the afternoon, towards the wildest and most dreary piece of
      scenery that I have ever met with in this part of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wild and dreary of a truth was the Moss, and the stormy sky, the moaning
      wind, and the occasional gushes of driving rain, suited well with the dark
      and cheerless region into which we had entered by a road, if a rude
      cart-track may be so called, such as shall seldom be encountered in this
      land of Macadamisation. And yet, partly perhaps from their novelty, the
      wild day and the wild scenery had for me a strange and thrilling charm.
      The ground, covered with the sea-green moss, whence it derived its name,
      mingled in the higher parts with brown patches of heather, and dark bushes
      of stunted furze, was broken with deep hollows full of stagnant water;
      some almost black, others covered with the rusty scum which denoted the
      presence of the powerful mineral, upon whose agency we relied for
      performing that strange piece of natural magic which may almost be called
      the transmutation of flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the ruddiest of these pools, situated in a deep glen, our active
      coadjutors, leaving phaeton, cart, and horses, on the brow of the hill,
      began rolling and tossing the several tubs, buckets, watering-pots, sacks,
      and spades, which were destined for the removal and conveyance of the much
      coveted-bog; we followed, amused and pleased, as, in certain moods,
      physical and mental, people are pleased and amused at self-imposed
      difficulties, down the abrupt and broken descent; and for some time the
      process of digging among the mould at the edge of the bank went steadily
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes, however, Dick, whose quick and restless eye was never
      long bent on any single object, most of all when that object presented
      itself in the form of work, exclaimed to his comrade, "Look at those
      children wandering about amongst the firs, like the babes in the wood in
      the old ballad. What can they be about?" And looking in the direction to
      which he pointed, we saw, amidst the gloomy fir plantations, which formed
      a dark and massive border nearly round the Moss, our old friends Harry and
      Bessy Leigh, collecting, as it seemed, the fir cones with which the ground
      was strewed, and depositing them carefully in a large basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      A manful shout from my companion soon brought the children to our side&mdash;good,
      busy, cheerful, and healthy-looking as ever, and marvellously improved in
      the matter of equipment. Harry had been promoted to a cap, which added the
      grace of a flourish to his bow; Bessy had added the luxury of a pinafore
      to her nondescript garments; and both pairs of little feet were advanced
      to the certain dignity, although somewhat equivocal comfort, of shoes and
      stockings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world had gone well with them, and with their parents. The house was
      built. Upon remounting the hill, and advancing a little farther into the
      centre of the Moss, we saw the comfortable low-browed cottage, full of
      light and shadow, of juttings out, and corners and angles of every sort
      and description, with a garden stretching along the side, backed and
      sheltered by the tall impenetrable plantation, a wall of trees, against
      whose dark masses a wreath of light smoke was curling, whose fragrance
      seemed really to perfume the winter air. The pig had been bought, fatted,
      and killed; but other pigs were inhabiting the sty, almost as large as
      their former dwelling, which stood at the end of their garden; and the
      children told with honest joy how all this prosperity had come about.
      Their father, taking some brooms to my kind friend Lady Denys, had seen
      some of the ornamental baskets used for flowers upon a lawn, and had been
      struck with the fancy of trying to make some, decorated with fir cones;
      and he had been so successful in this profitable manufacture, that he had
      more orders than he could execute. Lady Denys had also, with
      characteristic benevolence, put the children to her Sunday-school. One
      misfortune had a little overshadowed the sunshine. Squire Benson had died,
      and the consent to the erection of the cottage being only verbal, the
      attorney who managed for the infant heir, a ward in Chancery, had claimed
      the property. But the matter had been compromised upon the payment of such
      a rent as the present prospects of the family would fairly allow. Besides
      collecting fir cones for the baskets, they picked up all they could in
      that pine forest, (for it was little less,) and sold such as were
      discoloured, or otherwise unfit for working up, to Lady Denys and other
      persons who liked the fine aromatic odour of these the pleasantest of
      pastilles, in their dressing-room or drawing-room fires. "Did I like the
      smell? We had a cart there&mdash;might they bring us a hamper-ful?" And it
      was with great difficulty that a trifling present (for we did not think of
      offering money <i>as payment</i>) could be forced upon the grateful
      children. "We," they said, "had been their first friends." For what very
      small assistance the poor are often deeply, permanently thankful! Well
      says the great poet&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "I've heard of hearts unkind, good deeds
     With ill deeds still returning;
     Alas, the gratitude of man
     Hath oftener left me mourning!"
               Wordsworth.
</pre>
    <p>
      Again for above a year we lost sight of our little favourites, for such
      they were with both of us; though absence, indisposition, business,
      company&mdash;engagements, in short, of many sorts&mdash;combined to keep
      us from the Moss for upwards of a twelvemonth. Early in the succeeding
      April, however, it happened that, discussing with some morning visiters
      the course of a beautiful winding brook, (one of the tributaries to the
      Loddon, which bright and brimming river has nearly as many sources as the
      Nile,) one of them observed that the well-head was in Lanton Wood, and
      that it was a bit of scenery more like the burns of the North Countrie (my
      visiter was a Northumbrian) than anything he had seen in the south. Surely
      I had seen it? I was half ashamed to confess that I had not&mdash;(how
      often are we obliged to confess that we have not seen the beauties which
      lie close to our doors, too near for observation!)&mdash;and the next day
      proving fine, I determined to repair my omission.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a soft and balmy April morning, just at that point of the flowery
      spring when violets and primroses are lingering under the northern
      hedgerows, and cowslips and orchises peeping out upon the sunny banks. My
      driver was the clever, shrewd, arch boy Dick; and the first part of our
      way lay along the green winding lanes which lead to Everley; we then
      turned to the left, and putting up our phaeton at a small farmhouse, where
      my attendant (who found acquaintances everywhere) was intimate, we
      proceeded to the wood; Dick accompanying me, carrying my flower-basket,
      opening the gates, and taking care of my dog Dash, a very beautiful
      thorough-bred Old English spaniel, who was a little apt, when he got into
      a wood, to run after the game, and forget to come out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have seldom seen anything in woodland scenery more picturesque and
      attractive than the old coppice of Lanton, on that soft and balmy April
      morning. The underwood was nearly cut, and bundles of long split poles for
      hooping barrels were piled together against the tall oak trees, bursting
      with their sap; whilst piles of faggots were built up in other parts of
      the copse, and one or two saw-pits, with light open sheds erected over
      them, whence issued the measured sound of the saw and the occasional
      voices of the workmen, almost concealed by their subterranean position,
      were placed in the hollows. At the far side of the coppice, the operation
      of hewing down the underwood was still proceeding, and the sharp strokes
      of the axe and the bill, softened by distance, came across the monotonous
      jar of the never-ceasing saw. The surface of the ground was prettily
      tumbled about, comprehending as pleasant a variety of hill and dale as
      could well be comprised in some thirty acres. It declined, however,
      generally speaking, towards the centre of the coppice, along which a
      small, very small rivulet, scarcely more than a runlet, wound its way in a
      thousand graceful meanders. Tracking upward the course of the little
      stream, we soon arrived at that which had been the ostensible object of
      our drive&mdash;the spot whence it sprung.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a steep irregular acclivity on the highest side of the wood, a
      mound, I had almost said a rock, of earth, cloven in two about the middle,
      but with so narrow a fissure that the brushwood which grew on either side
      nearly filled up the opening, so that the source of the spring still
      remained concealed, although the rapid gushing of the water made a
      pleasant music in that pleasant place; and here and there a sunbeam,
      striking upon the sparkling stream, shone with a bright and glancing light
      amidst the dark ivies, and brambles, and mossy stumps of trees, that grew
      around.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mound had apparently been cut a year or two ago, so that it presented
      an appearance of mingled wildness and gaiety, that contrasted very
      agreeably with the rest of the coppice; whose trodden-down flowers I had
      grieved over, even whilst admiring the picturesque effect of the
      woodcutters and their several operations. Here, however, reigned the
      flowery spring in all her glory. Violets, pansies, orchises, oxslips, the
      elegant woodsorrel, the delicate wood anemone, and the enamelled wild
      hyacinth, were sprinkled profusely amongst the mosses, and lichens, and
      dead leaves, which formed so rich a carpet beneath our feet. Primroses,
      above all, were there of almost every hue, from the rare and pearly white,
      to the deepest pinkish purple, coloured by some diversity of soil, the
      pretty freak of nature's gardening; whilst the common yellow blossom&mdash;commonest
      and prettiest of all&mdash;peeped out from amongst the boughs in the stump
      of an old willow, like (to borrow the simile of a dear friend, now no
      more) a canary bird from its cage. The wild geranium was already showing
      its pink stem and scarlet-edged leaves, themselves almost gorgeous enough
      to pass for flowers; the periwinkle, with its wreaths of shining foliage,
      was hanging in garlands over the precipitous descent; and the lily of the
      valley, the fragrant woodroof, and the silvery wild garlick, were just
      peeping from the earth in the most sheltered nooks. Charmed to find myself
      surrounded by so much beauty, I had scrambled, with much ado, to the top
      of the woody cliff, (no other word can convey an idea of its precipitous
      abruptness,) and was vainly attempting to trace by my eye the actual
      course of the spring, which was, by the clearest evidence of sound,
      gushing from the fount many feet below me; when a peculiar whistle of
      delight, (for whistling was to Dick, although no ordinary proficient in
      our common tongue, another language,) and a tremendous scrambling amongst
      the bushes, gave token that my faithful attendant had met with something
      as agreeable to his fancy, as the primroses and orchises had proved to
      mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guided by a repetition of the whistle, I soon saw my trusty adherent
      spanning the chasm like a Colossus, one foot on one bank, the other on the
      opposite&mdash;each of which appeared to me to be resting, so to say, on
      nothing&mdash;tugging away at a long twig that grew on the brink of the
      precipice, and exceedingly likely to resolve the inquiry as to the source
      of the Loddon, by plumping souse into the fountain-head. I, of course,
      called out to warn him; and he equally, of course, went on with his
      labour, without paying the slightest attention to my caution. On the
      contrary, having possessed himself of one straight slender twig, which, to
      my great astonishment, he wound round his fingers, and deposited in his
      pocket, as one should do by a bit of pack-thread, he apparently, during
      the operation, caught sight of another. Testifying his delight by a second
      whistle, which, having his knife in his mouth, one wonders how he could
      accomplish; and scrambling with the fearless daring of a monkey up the
      perpendicular bank, supported by strings of ivy, or ledges of roots, and
      clinging by hand and foot to the frail bramble or the slippery moss,
      leaping like a squirrel from bough to bough, and yet, by happy boldness,
      escaping all danger, he attained his object as easily as if he had been
      upon level ground. Three, four, five times was the knowing, joyous,
      triumphant whistle sounded, and every time with a fresh peril and a fresh
      escape. At last, the young gentleman, panting and breathless, stood at my
      side, and I began to question him as to the treasure he had been pursuing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the ground-ash, ma'am," responded master Dick, taking one of the
      coils from his pocket; "the best riding-switch in the world. All the whips
      that ever were made are nothing to it. Only see how strong it is, how
      light, and how supple! You may twist it a thousand ways without breaking.
      It won't break, do what you will. Each of these, now, is worth
      half-a-crown or three shillings, for they are the scarcest things
      possible. They grow up at a little distance from the root of an old tree,
      like a sucker from a rose-bush. Great luck, indeed!" continued Dick,
      putting up his treasure with another joyful whistle; "it was but t'other
      day that Jack Barlow offered me half-a-guinea for four, if I could but
      come by them. I shall certainly keep the best, though, for myself&mdash;unless,
      ma'am, you would be pleased to accept it for the purpose of whipping
      Dash." Whipping Dash!!! Well have I said that Dick was as saucy as a
      lady's page or a king's jester. Talk of whipping Dash! Why, the young
      gentleman knew perfectly well that I had rather be whipt myself twenty
      times over. The very sound seemed a profanation. Whip my Dash! Of course I
      read master Dick a lecture for this irreverent mention of my pet, who,
      poor fellow, hearing his name called in question, came up in all innocence
      to fondle me; to which grave remonstrance the hopeful youth replied by
      another whistle, half of penitence, half of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      These discourses brought us to the bottom of the mound, and turning round
      a clump of hawthorn and holly, we espied a little damsel with a basket at
      her side, and a large knife in her hand, carefully digging up a large root
      of white primroses, and immediately recognised my old acquaintance, Bessy
      Leigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was, as before, clean, and healthy, and tidy, and unaffectedly glad to
      see me; but the joyousness and buoyancy which had made so much of her
      original charm, were greatly diminished. It was clear that poor Bessy had
      suffered worse griefs than those of cold and hunger; and upon questioning
      her, so it turned out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father had died, and her mother had been ill, and the long hard winter
      had been hard to get through; and then the rent had come upon her, and the
      steward (for the young gentleman himself was a minor) had threatened to
      turn them out if it were not paid to a day&mdash;the very next day after
      that on which we were speaking; and her mother had been afraid they must
      go to the workhouse, which would have been a sad thing, because now she
      had got so much washing to do, and Harry was so clever at basket-making,
      that there was every chance, this rent once paid, of their getting on
      comfortably. "And the rent will be paid now, ma'am, thank Ood!" added
      Bessy, her sweet face brightening; "for we want only a guinea of the whole
      sum, and Lady Denys has employed me to get scarce wild-flowers for her
      wood, and has promised me half-a-guinea for what I have carried her, and
      this last parcel, which I am to take to the lodge to-night; and Mr. John
      Barlow, her groom, has offered Harry twelve and sixpence for five
      ground-ashes that Harry has been so lucky as to find by the spring, and
      Harry is gone to cut them: so that now we shall get on bravely, and mother
      need not fret any longer. I hope no harm will befal Harry in getting the
      ground-ash, though, for it's a noted dangerous place. But he's a careful
      boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this point of her little speech, poor Bessy was interrupted by her
      brother, who ran down the declivity exclaiming, "They're gone, Bessy!&mdash;they're
      gone! somebody has taken them! the ground-ashes are gone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick put his hand irresolutely to his pocket, and then, uttering a dismal
      whistle, pulled it resolutely out again, with a hardness, or an
      affectation of hardness, common to all lads, from the prince to the
      stable-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also put my hand into my pocket, and found, with the deep disappointment
      which often punishes such carelessness, that I had left my purse at home.
      All that I could do, therefore, was to bid the poor children be comforted,
      and ascertain at what time Bessy intended to take her roots, which in the
      midst of her distress she continued to dig up, to my excellent friend Lady
      Denys. I then, exhorting them to hope the best, made my way quickly out of
      the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the gate, I missed my attendant. Before, however, I had reached
      the farm at which we had left our phaeton, I heard his gayest and most
      triumphant whistle behind me. Thinking of the poor children, it jarred
      upon my feelings. "Where have you been loitering, Sir?" I asked, in a
      sterner voice than he had probably ever heard from me before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where have I been?" replied he; "giving little Harry the ground-ashes, to
      be sure: I felt just as if I had stolen them. And now, I do believe,"
      continued he, with a prodigious burst of whistling, which seemed to me as
      melodious as the song of the nightingale, "I do believe," quoth Dick,
      "that I am happier than they are. I would not have kept those
      ground-ashes, no, not for fifty pounds!"
